Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is the developer of the game Draw It or Lose It, and they wanted us to design a multi-platform web-based version of their game in order to expand it's reach.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did a great job breaking down the nuances of the different operating platforms and chosing the best one for our purposes.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found the step-by-step approach that broke one large project into three projects over the course of the semester to be very helpful, allowing me to see how the concepts we learned work together as a whole. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
There isn't one part that speaks to me directly, although I do believe I could redo the entire project and improve it - as I am still at the begining of my journey and there is always room for improvment.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I kept the user's goal of expanding their player base in mind while selecting the final operating system, as even though there are many pros and cons to each system - at the end of the day the goals of the developer
should be our goals as well.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach was one of curiosity and exploration - being new to the field I try and absorb as many new ideas and skills as I can. I think it would be helpful to keep this mindset, even as I progress in my journey as there is always new things to learn and skills to master.
